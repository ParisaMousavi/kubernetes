# The journey of an App to the Kunernetes World

``Kubernetes can be up and run on a machine or machines based on the throughput we need`` **-> This a rule**

**On-Prem**: Machine can be a physical machine or a VM.
**On-Cloud**: Machine is a VM and it doesn't matter by which cloud provider.

A small ``hello-world`` application must be containerized and converted to a ``container iamge`` to be able to travel to the Kubernetes World. **-> This is the prerequisite**


In the Kubernetes world we have provinces that are called ``Cluster``. 

In each province we have serveral cities that are called ``Worker Node``. 

Each city has serveral houses called ``Pod``. 

Each app (which is containerized and is working as a ``container`` right now) lives in one Pod. In some pods some containeres live together.

Each city in the kubernetes world has usually three different section.
